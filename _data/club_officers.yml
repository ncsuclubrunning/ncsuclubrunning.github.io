  biography: "Hey y’all! I am a sophomore majoring in Industrial Engineering and minoring in Statistics, and I am from Martinsville, VA. I’ve been running close to 10 years and plan to run even farther in my life. Outside of running, I love to do anything outdoors, watch YouTube videos on various subjects, or just hangout with my close friends. I’ve only been on campus for a short amount of time, but I’m excited to meet even more people as I begin my time as the club secretary."

I also compete in Spartan Races alongside cross country and track and would definitely recommend them. Other than running, I enjoy playing video games from time to time, binge watching YouTube while eating “healthy” food, and often finding myself at a trampoline park. I’m looking forward to meeting new people on the team and I hope to be a good Vice President!"

I started running as a freshman in high school and have been running competitively ever since. When I’m not exploring the outdoors through running, I enjoy hiking, camping and going out with my friends to play sports and just hang out. I have met many great people through this amazing running club here at NC State and am looking forward to meeting many more. I hope to assist Coach B in developing quality training and helping us become the best runners we can be this upcoming season. I look forward to seeing all of you at practice!"

  biography: "Howdy! I'm a junior in Computer Science from Hillsborough, NC. I started running local road races with my Dad when I was very young, and have had a passion for the sport as soon as I realized I was decent at it. I am very blessed to have the opportunity to run with the guys and girls on this awesome team, and have made some amazing friends in the two and half years I've been at NC State. When I'm not at practice, you can find me grinding out creative Strava posts, binge-reading on Wikipedia, and watching all kinds of stuff on YouTube. I look very forward to serving the club through operating the club website and hope to bring some really cool improvements throughout the year!"
